Moreover, a desire within the antahkaran to enjoy those vishays that have not been previously indulged in is also called ‘vāsanā’.”\n\nThereafter Muktānand Swāmi asked, “Mahārāj, who can be called an ekāntik bhakta of God?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “A person who has no ‘vāsanā’ except that of God and who offers bhakti to God realizing himself to be brahmarup is called an ekāntik bhakta .”\n\nOn Magshar sudi 14, Samvat 1876 [30 November 1819], Shriji Maharaj was sitting in Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
