He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Thereupon Chaitanyānand Swāmi asked, “Mahārāj, what are the characteristics of jealousy?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “Jealousy develops from the egotism that a person harbors within his heart. In fact, anger, matsar and asuyā also arise out of egotism. But the characteristic of jealousy is that one cannot bear to see even someone greater than oneself being honored. A person who has such a nature should be known to have jealousy within his heart. Moreover, one who has extreme jealousy cannot bear anyone’s greatness.”\n\nOn Shravan vadi 12, Samvat 1877 [4 September 1820], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Jiva Khachar’s darbar in Sarangpur.
