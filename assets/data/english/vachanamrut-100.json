He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Thereupon Shriji Mahārāj said, “Please ask and answer questions amongst yourselves.”\n\nSo Gopālānand Swāmi asked Bhajanānand Swāmi, “In this body, how much awareness is of the jiva , and how much awareness is of the witness ?” 1\n\nBhajanānand Swāmi attempted to answer the question but was unable to do so.\n\nShriji Mahārāj then replied, “The buddhi pervades this body from head to toe. As a result, it is simultaneously aware of the activities of all of the indriyas . The jiva resides within that buddhi by pervading it. So, the awareness of the buddhi is due to the awareness of the jiva . Similarly, since the witness resides within that jiva , the jiva’s awareness is due to the witness’s awareness.”\n\nThereafter Nityānand Swāmi asked Shriji Mahārāj, “Mahārāj, the witness does reside within the jiva . But realizing that that which is a witness must possess a form, the question is how can that which possesses a form also be pervasive?”\n\nHearing this, Shriji Mahārāj explained, “That which possesses a form can also be pervasive. For example, Agnidev possesses a definite form when residing in his realm, but through his powers, he is latent within wood. Similarly, God possesses a definite form in His Akshardhām, but through His antaryāmi powers, He pervades the jivas and functions as if He possesses a form. Therefore, even that antaryāmi form should be considered to possess a form.”\n\nFour-and-a-half hours after sunrise on Aso vadi 8, Samvat 1877 [29 October 1820], Shriji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the north-facing rooms of Vasta Khachar’s darbar in Kariyani.
