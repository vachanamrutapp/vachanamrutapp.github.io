He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Thereupon Muktānand Swāmi asked Shriji Mahārāj, “A devotee of God resolves in his mind, ‘I do not want to retain a single swabhāv which may hinder me in worshipping God,’ and yet, such inappropriate swabhāvs do remain. What is the reason for this?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “If a person has a deficiency of vairāgya , then even if he has the shraddhā to eradicate his swabhāvs , still they will not be eradicated. For example, a poor man may wish for lots of sumptuous food and lavish clothes, but how can he acquire them? Similarly, one who lacks vairāgya may wish in his heart to acquire the virtues of a sādhu , but it is very difficult for him to do so.”\n\nMuktānand Swāmi then asked, “If a person does not possess vairāgya , what means should he adopt to eradicate those vicious natures?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “If a person lacking vairāgya intensely serves a great Sant and obediently perseveres in his observance of the injunctions of God, then God will look upon him with an eye of compassion and feel, ‘This poor fellow lacks vairāgya , and lust, anger, etc., are harassing him very much. So now, may all those vicious natures be eradicated.’ As a result, they will be eradicated immediately. In comparison, if he were to endeavor in other ways, those swabhāvs may be eradicated, but after a great deal of time and effort - either in this life or in later lives. If such vicious natures are eradicated instantly, then it should be known that they have been eradicated by the grace of God.”\n\nOn the night of Shravan sudi 11, Samvat 1878 [9 August 1821], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in front of the mandir of Shri Vasudevnarayan in Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
