He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, Premānand Swāmi was singing devotional songs to the accompaniment of a sarodā , while munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly.",
    "text": "Thereupon Shriji Mahārāj said, “Let us conduct a question-answer session.” So saying, Shriji Mahārāj Himself asked, “A devotee of God who is gunātit behaves only as the ātmā , above the influence of the three gunas - i.e., above sattvagun in the form of vairāgya , above rajogun in the form of desires for vishays , and above tamogun in the form of passiveness. He harbors absolutely no thoughts and experiences a deep sleep-like state. Now, does such a nirgun devotee who behaves as the ātmā in this manner have love for God or not? That is the question.”\n\nMuktānand Swāmi replied, “One who behaves as the ātmā does have love for God.”\n\nHearing the reply, Shriji Mahārāj asked, “Is the love of such a devotee who behaves as the ātmā of the same qualities as the ātmā or different?”\n\nMuktānand Swāmi replied, “That love is of the same qualities as the ātmā .”\n\nShriji Mahārāj then explained, “Regarding the love developed for God while behaving as the ātmā , Madhvāchārya, Nimbārk and Vallabhāchārya have all described that love as brahmaswarup . Therefore, only one who has love for God having become gunātit is brahmaswarup . Such is the principle of the great āchāryas .”\n\nOn Posh sudi 4, Samvat 1880 [5 January 1824], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was seated on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow at the residence of the Ayodhyawasis in Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
