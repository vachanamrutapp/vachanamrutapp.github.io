    "text": "Thereupon Dinānāth Bhatt asked a question: “Mahārāj, kāl is the power of God, and karma refers to the actions performed by the jiva . But what exactly is ‘swabhāv’?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj explained, “The karmas that the jiva has performed during past lives have fully ripened and have become assimilated with the jiva . Just as fire ‘enters’ iron, similarly, those karmas have ripened and have become one with the jiva . It is those karmas that are known as ‘swabhāv’, or ‘vāsanā’, or ‘prakruti’.”\n\nMuktānand Swāmi then asked, “Mahārāj, You call the karmas which have become assimilated with the jiva , ‘swabhāv’ or ‘vāsanā’. But how does one eradicate ‘vāsanā’?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “It appears that the only means to do so is by performing the bhakti of Shri Krishna Bhagwān, coupled with the realization of one’s self as the ātmā . If one offers bhakti to Shri Krishna Bhagwān without ātmā -realization, then just as one has love for God, one will also develop love for other material objects. Therefore, bhakti accompanied by ātmā -realization is the only means to eradicate ‘vāsanā’. However, even one who has ātmā -realization may be disturbed by adverse circumstances, just like an ignorant person. But such disturbances do not last long.”\n\nOn the night of Shravan vadi Amas, Samvat 1884 [22 August 1827], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in His residence in Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.

At that time, an assembly of sadhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.\n\nThereupon Dinanath Bhatt asked a question: “Maharaj, kal is the power of God, and karma refers to the actions performed by the jiva . But what exactly is ‘swabhav’?”\n\nShriji Maharaj explained, “The karmas that the jiva has performed during past lives have fully ripened and have become assimilated with the jiva .

But how does one eradicate ‘vasana’?”\n\nShriji Maharaj replied, “It appears that the only means to do so is by performing the bhakti of Shri Krishna Bhagwan, coupled with the realization of one’s self as the atma . If one offers bhakti to Shri Krishna Bhagwan without atma -realization, then just as one has love for God, one will also develop love for other material objects. Therefore, bhakti accompanied by atma -realization is the only means to eradicate ‘vasana’.
