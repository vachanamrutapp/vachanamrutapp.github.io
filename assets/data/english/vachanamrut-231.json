He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of mogrā flowers adorned His neck, and tassels of mogrā flowers decorated His pāgh . At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Thereupon Shriji Mahārāj asked the munis , “How can a devotee of God remain eternally happy?” The senior sādhus replied according to their understanding, but then Shriji Mahārāj Himself said, “The answer is that a devotee of God who, firstly, has firm vairāgya ; who, secondly, has extremely firm swadharma ; who has gained control over all of his indriyas by these two means; who has intense love for God and His Bhakta; who has a close friendship with God and His Bhakta; who never becomes indifferent towards God and His Bhakta; and who is pleased only by the company of God and His Bhakta, but does not like the company of a non-believer - remains eternally happy in this realm and beyond.\n\n“A person who has not controlled his indriyas by vairāgya and swadharma remains miserable, despite staying in the company of God and His Bhakta. Why? Because he who has not gained control over his indriyas does not experience happiness anywhere. Even while engaged in bhakti towards God, when the indriyas are drawn towards the vishays , that devotee experiences extreme misery in his heart. Thus, only one who gains control over one’s indriyas remains eternally happy. Furthermore, only one who has gained control over one’s indriyas should be known to have vairāgya and dharma . One who has not controlled one’s indriyas should not be known to possess vairāgya and dharma . Therefore, since a person who has vairāgya and dharma has restraint over all of his indriyas , he is eternally happy.”\n\nThen Muktānand Swāmi asked, “Mahārāj, for a devotee of God, what is one of the greatest obstacle in his bhakti towards God?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “For a devotee of God, the greatest obstacles are that he does not realize his own drawbacks, his mind becomes aloof from God and His Bhakta, and he develops indifference towards the Bhakta of God. These are the greatest obstacles for a devotee.”\n\nOn Bhadarva vadi 9, Samvat 1883 [25 September 1826], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
