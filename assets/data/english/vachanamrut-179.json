    "setting": "On Posh vadi 11, Samvat 1880 [26 January 1824], Swāmi Shri Sahajānandji Mahārāj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dādā Khāchar’s darbār in Gadhadā. He was dressed entirely in white clothes and had covered Himself with a yellow blanket made of chhint . At that time, some sādhus were singing devotional songs to the accompaniment of a jhānjh and mrudang ; while other munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly.",
    "text": "After the singing concluded, Shriji Mahārāj said, “A Satpurush living in this world is not pleased or pained upon seeing the worldly progress or regress of a person. However, when someone’s mind recedes from the path of God, he does become grieved. After all, life is so short; and if a person’s afterlife is ruined, it would indeed be a great loss for that person.\n\n“In fact, God assumes avatārs upon earth for the purpose of establishing dharma , and that too, not simply for the establishment of the dharma of one’s caste and āshram . After all, even the āchāryas of pravrutti dharma , such as the Saptarshi and others have established the dharma of the four castes and āshrams . God does not, however, assume avatārs solely for that purpose; He assumes avatārs to expound the dharma of His ekāntik bhaktas .\n\n“For such ekāntik bhaktas , leaving the body is not considered to be death; rather, for them, falling from that ekāntik dharma is true death. This occurs when an aversion arises in one’s heart towards God or His Sant. It is then that that devotee should be known to have fallen from the dharma of ekāntik bhaktas . If, for example, he has fallen due to anger, it should be known that he has received the body of a snake; and if he has fallen due to lust, then it should be known that he has taken birth as an evil spirit or a demon.\n\n“Nevertheless, despite having attained such bodies and having fallen from ekāntik dharma , those who observe dharma or perform austerities will attain Devlok due to their observance of dharma or their performance of austerities. However, one who bears an aversion towards God or His Sant will certainly not attain the abode of God. On the other hand, even if a person has committed the five grave sins, if he has not perceived a flaw in God or His Sant, then his sins will be burned, and he will dwell in the abode of God. Therefore, to perceive flaws in God and His Bhakta is a graver sin than committing the five grave sins.”\n\nOn Posh vadi 11, Samvat 1880 [26 January 1824], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms of Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
