He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with an orange reto that had a border of interlaced golden and silver threads. He had also tied a feto around His head using a sky-blue, silk cloth that was similarly rich. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Thereupon Muktānand Swāmi asked, “Mahārāj, through the dialogue between King Janak and the nine Yogeshwars, the 11 th canto of the Shrimad Bhāgwat describes the nature of bhāgwat dharma . How is that bhāgwat dharma upheld? Also, how can the gateway to liberation be opened?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “ Bhāgwat dharma is upheld by maintaining profound love towards the Ekāntik Sant of God, who possesses the attributes of swadharma , gnān , vairāgya , and bhakti coupled with knowledge of God’s greatness. Maintaining profound love towards such a Sant also opens the gateway to liberation. Thus, Kapildev Bhagwān has said to Devhuti:\n\n“‘If a person maintains profound love towards the Ekāntik Sant of God just as resolutely as he maintains profound love towards his own relatives, then the gateway to liberation opens for him.’”\n\nThereafter Shuk Muni asked, “By what characteristic can one recognize a person who would never lapse in his observance of dharma , even under the most difficult circumstances?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj replied, “A person whose nature is such that he is diligent in obeying the injunctions of God, and who would never disobey any injunction, however minor or major, will never regress from observing dharma , irrespective of the circumstances. Therefore, only his dharma remains firm who is resolute in obeying God’s injunctions, and only his satsang remains firm.”\n\nOn Maha vadi 11, Samvat 1876 [10 February 1820], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow which had been placed on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the west-facing rooms in front of the mandir of Shri Vasudevnarayan in Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
