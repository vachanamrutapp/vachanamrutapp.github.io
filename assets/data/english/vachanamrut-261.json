He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Thereupon Shriji Mahārāj said, “Having pondered over the Sānkhya scriptures as well as other scriptures, I have formed the conviction that all forms that are the result of the entities evolved from māyā are false. Why? Because all those forms will be destroyed by kāl . Conversely, the form of God in Akshardhām and the form of the muktas - the attendants of God - are all satya , divine and extremely luminous. Also, the form of that God and those muktas is two-armed like that of a human being, and it is characterized by eternal existence, consciousness and bliss. That God, residing in Akshardhām, is served by those muktas with various types of divine articles, and He is always present there to bestow supreme bliss upon those muktas .\n\n“It is that same supreme Purushottam Bhagwān who manifests on this earth out of compassion - for the purpose of granting liberation to the jivas . He is presently visible before everyone; He is your Ishtadev; and He accepts your service. In fact, there is absolutely no difference between the manifest form of Purushottam Bhagwān visible before you and the form of God residing in Akshardhām; i.e., both are one. Moreover, this manifest form of Purushottam Bhagwān is the controller of all, including Akshar. He is the lord of all of the ishwars and the cause of all causes. He reigns supreme, and He is the cause of all of the avatārs . Moreover, He is worthy of being worshipped single-mindedly by all of you. The many previous avatārs of this God are worthy of being bowed down to and worthy of reverence.”\n\nShriji Mahārāj then explained, “Greed for wealth and other things, desires to associate with women, attachment of the tongue to various tastes, the belief that one is the body, affection for kusangis and attachment to one’s relatives - one who possesses these six characteristics will never become happy, either in this life or even after death. Therefore, one who desires to be happy should eradicate such swabhāvs , maintain nivrutti , and not keep the company of equals. One should also attach one’s jiva to the Bhakta of God - the great Sant - who does not identify his self with the body, who possesses vairāgya , and who feels that he has transgressed a major injunction of God even if he has transgressed a minor injunction. One should act according to his command by thought, word and deed. Also, one should certainly avoid the vishays , and in no way should one allow them to come near by abandoning one’s niyams . If one does begin to associate with the vishays , one will certainly fall. This should be accepted as a universal principle.”\n\nOn Vaishakh sudi 14, Samvat 1885 [17 May 1829], Swami Shri Sahajanandji Maharaj was sitting in the mandir of Shri Gopinathji in Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
