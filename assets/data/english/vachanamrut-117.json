    "setting": "On Māgshar sudi 6, Samvat 1877 [11 December 1820], Shriji Mahārāj was sitting in Surā Khāchar’s darbār in Loyā. He was wearing a white dagli made of chhint as well as a white survāl . He had also tied a white feto around His head. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Then Shriji Mahārāj requested, “May all of the paramhansas please engage in a question-answer session amongst themselves.”\n\nThereupon Ātmānand Swāmi asked Akhandānand Swāmi, “What are the factors that lead to the development of the four virtues of vairāgya , gnān , bhakti and dharma ?”\n\nShriji Mahārāj answered the question, “ Vairāgya is cultivated when one comes to realize the nature of kāl . What is this nature of kāl ? Well, it is to know the process of nitya-pralay , nimitta-pralay , prākrut-pralay and ātyantik-pralay , as well as the lifespan of all beings from Brahmā to the smallest blade of grass. After knowing this, if one realizes the body, the brahmānd and all other objects to be subject to the force of kāl , then vairāgya would arise.\n\n“ Gnān arises if one listens to the Upanishads such as the Bruhadāranya Upanishad, Chhāndogya Upanishad, Kathavalli Upanishad, etc.; the Bhagwad Gitā; the Vāsudev Māhātmya; the Vyās Sutras and other scriptures from a Satpurush.\n\n“ Dharma arises if one listens to the Yāgnavalkya Smruti, Manu Smruti, Parāshar Smruti, Shankh-likhit Smruti and other Smrutis. By doing so, dharma would arise, and one would develop faith in those scriptures.\n\n“ Bhakti arises if one realizes the divine manifestations of God. How should one realize them? Well, when one hears about the forms of God that are in each khand ; and when one hears about the abodes of God - Golok, Vaikunth, Brahmapur, Shwetdwip, etc.; and when one listens with a sense of awe to talks of the divine actions of God describing the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the cosmos; and when one listens with keen interest to the narration of the divine actions and incidents of Rām, Krishna and the other avatārs of God, then bhakti towards God would develop.\n\n“Now, even though a person in his initial stages has an immature mind, if he listens to the ritualistic Smrutis, dharma would develop. Later, after becoming firm in his observance of dharma , if he listens to scriptures that explain upāsanā , then all three - gnān , bhakti and vairāgya - would develop. So, these are the factors which lead to the development of the four virtues.”\n\nOn Magshar sudi 6, Samvat 1877 [11 December 1820], Shriji Maharaj was sitting in Sura Khachar’s darbar in Loya. He was wearing a white dagli made of chhint as well as a white surval . He had also tied a white feto around His head. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.\n\nThen Shriji Maharaj requested, “May all of the paramhansas please engage in a question-answer session amongst themselves.”\n\nThereupon Atmanand Swami asked Akhandanand Swami, “What are the factors that lead to the development of the four virtues of vairagya , gnan , bhakti and dharma ?”\n\nShriji Maharaj answered the question, “ Vairagya is cultivated when one comes to realize the nature of kal . What is this nature of kal ? Well, it is to know the process of nitya-pralay , nimitta-pralay , prakrut-pralay and atyantik-pralay , as well as the lifespan of all beings from Brahma to the smallest blade of grass. After knowing this, if one realizes the body, the brahmand and all other objects to be subject to the force of kal , then vairagya would arise.\n\n“ Gnan arises if one listens to the Upanishads such as the Bruhadaranya Upanishad, Chhandogya Upanishad, Kathavalli Upanishad, etc.; the Bhagwad Gita; the Vasudev Mahatmya; the Vyas Sutras and other scriptures from a Satpurush.\n\n“ Dharma arises if one listens to the Yagnavalkya Smruti, Manu Smruti, Parashar Smruti, Shankh-likhit Smruti and other Smrutis.
