    "setting": "On the evening of Mahā sudi 7, Samvat 1876 [22 January 1820], Shriji Mahārāj was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dādā Khāchar’s darbār in Gadhadā. He had tied a white pāgh around His head. He had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth and was wearing a white khes as well. Tassels of yellow flowers were dangling from His pāgh , and garlands of yellow flowers adorned His neck. Also, bunches of yellow flowers had been placed upon both of His ears. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.",
    "text": "Looking at all of the devotees with a compassionate gaze, Shriji Mahārāj said, “I wish to ask a question, so please listen.” He then began, “The Shrimad Bhāgwat Purān states: ‘Those who are devotees of God do not desire any of the four types of liberation.’ Other great devotees of God also say, ‘Devotees of God do not wish for the four types of liberation.’ What are the four types of liberation? Well, the first is to reside in the realm of God; the second is to stay near God; the third is to assume a form similar to that of God; and the fourth is to attain divine powers similar to God’s powers. These are the four types of liberation. A devotee of God does not wish for any of these; he wishes only to serve God. Now, My question is, ‘Why does that devotee not wish for the four types of liberation?’ Please answer according to your ability.”\n\nAll of the paramhansas attempted to answer the question but were unable to do so satisfactorily.\n\nThereupon Shriji Mahārāj said, “Here, I shall answer the question. One who maintains a desire for those four types of liberation after becoming a devotee of God is known as a ‘ sakām devotee’. In contrast, one who has no desires regarding the four types of liberation and who only desires to serve God is known as a ‘ nishkām devotee’. In fact, the Shrimad Bhāgwat states:\n\n“This means that a ‘ nishkām devotee’ of God does not wish for the four types of liberation if service, i.e., attending to God, is not included therein; he wishes only to serve God. In turn, God keeps him in His own service. God also insistently grants such a devotee His divine powers and bliss, even though the devotee does not wish for them. Kapildev Bhagwān has also said:\n\n“It is only such a ‘ nishkām devotee’ who has been referred to as a devotee with gnān by Krishna Bhagwān in the Gitā. A ‘ sakām devotee’, on the other hand, has been referred to as materialistic. Therefore, a devotee should not wish for anything except the service of God. After all, wishing for anything other than the service of God is considered to be a deficiency in that devotee. If one does have such a deficiency, it should be overcome by profound association with the desire-less Ekāntik Bhakta of God.”\n\nOn the evening of Maha sudi 7, Samvat 1876 [22 January 1820], Shriji Maharaj was sitting on a large, decorated cot on the veranda outside the east-facing rooms of Dada Khachar’s darbar in Gadhada.
